## Introduction

In this application exercise, you will: 

1. Install git and Julia;
2. set up a GitHub account;
3. "clone" a repository to your local machine;
4. edit a Jupyter notebook; and
5. write and run some basic code.

## Tasks

Your tasks are:

1. [Install `git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine if necessary. 
2. [Install Julia](#sec-install-julia) using the `juliaup` tool.
3. [Install and set up VS Code](#sec-install-code) if you don't already have an editor you'd like to use. VS Code is an editor of choice for Julia, as it as a rich and well-supported Julia extension. If you have a different coding environment, please find instructions for how to set it up to edit Julia.
4. [Set up a GitHub account and clone the application exercise repository](#sec-github).
5. [Open and edit the notebook](#sec-notebook).
6. [Export the notebook to a PDF](#sec-export-pdf).
7. Submit the PDF to Gradescope by the due date.

## Instructions

### Install Git

If you have already installed `git`, you don't need to worry about this section. If you haven't, [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) the appropriate version for your operating system.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Mac Versions

If you have a Mac, be aware if you have an Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) Mac or an Intel Mac. Many of the installations you will go through in this exercise have different versions for each processor type, and the program may not work properly if you still the wrong version. There's nothing that can't be undone, but it's easier to be install the correct version first!
:::

### Install Julia {#sec-install-julia}

I recommend installing Julia using the `juliaup` tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the [JuliaUp GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), but we will summarize them here.

#### Installing Juliaup on Windows

If your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup [from the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN).

#### Installing Juliaup on MacOS

If you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

#### Installing Julia 1.8.5

Once you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.8.5 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:
```shell
julia add 1.8.5
julia default 1.8.5
```

This will install Julia 1.8.5 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can [follow the Juliaup instructions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup).


### Install and Set Up VS Code {#sec-install-code}

You can skip this section if you already have a coding environment you like; just set it up to work with Julia. Otherwise, VS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow [this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/).

#### Installing VS Code

You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); open the downloaded file to install.

#### Install the Julia Extension

1. Open VS Code. 
2. Select View and click Extensions to open the Extension View. This view can also be found on the sidebar with the following logo: ![VS Code Extensions View Logo](figures/vs-code-extensions.png).
3. Search for `julia`in the search box. Click the green install button.
4. Restart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; talk to Vivek if not.

The Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the "Command Palette" (View -> Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing "REPL" to bring up "Julia: Start REPL". You can also create `*.jl` files to write Julia code and execute line by line. However, we will primarily use Jupyter notebooks in this class, but this might be useful for testing code or for your project.

#### Install the Jupyter Notebook Extension

The Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to export a Jupyter notebook to PDF or to HTML and then to PDF.

::: {.callout-tip}
## PDF Export for Gradescope

You will need to export every notebook to a PDF for submission to Gradescope. Direct export to PDF requires a LaTeX installation. If you would like to go this route, please look at [the LaTeX installation instructions for your operating system](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

Otherwise, exporting to HTML and then using your browser to save the resulting page to a PDF is a perfect solution.
:::

Follow the same instructions as above, but search for `jupyter` and install the Jupyter extension. Restart VS Code.


### Set Up GitHub {#sec-github}

#### Create GitHub Account

If you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account.

Otherwise, [create an account](https://github.com/join). It doesn't have to be linked to your Cornell email or use your Cornell NetID.

For labs and homework assignments (we will work on Lab 1 in class on Friday and Homework 1 is available), you should use the GitHub Classroom link to "accept" the assignment provided on Ed Discussion, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.

When application exercises require notebook use (which is the case here, but will not always be), you can follow the workflow in these next steps, and will be prompted to do so in the instructions for that exercise.

You can do almost everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code, or you can use the GitHub UI or the Terminal. We will assume in these instructions that you will just work through VS Code.

#### Clone the Repository

Once you have created your account, navigate to the [GitHub repository for the assignment](https://github.com/BEE4750/ae01). You will have your own repository for assignments that you accept through the GitHub Classroom links, but for now, let's use this common repository. Click the green "Code" button, and copy the URL by clicking on the clipboard icon.

![Code Clone Interface on GitHub](figures/github-clone.png)

Next, open a new VS Code window. You should see the following options.

![VS Code New Window](figures/vs-code-clone.png)

Click "Clone Git Repository" and select "Clone from GitHub" when it pops up. Paste the URL for the repository into the search bar and select the repository that comes up. You will then be prompted to pick a location to save the repository. I recommend keeping a single master folder for the course, which can then be divided into `aes` (for application exercises), `labs`, and `hws`. For example:

```
BEE4750
|---aes
|---labs
|---hws
```
Then, pick the appropriate subdirectory. When you clone the repository, it will automatically create a directory for the repository, so you do not need to create the `ae01` repository explicity. Just select `aes`.

Once you do that, you will be prompted to open the new folder. The next time you want to work on the notebook, pick "Open Folder" from the initial VS Code New Window page and find the folder that was created (for example `aes/ae01`.) Opening a folder is recommended, as it will provide a more convenient interface for working with the entire repository, versus opening a single file.

::: {.callout-important}
## Working with GitHub Repositories

In this assignment, we're only asking you to clone a Github repository. In Lab 1, you will be asked to "commit" and "push" your files to synchronize your local repository with your personal GitHub Classroom repository, which allows you to keep code updated. This is useful for ensuring that you have a backup of your files with tracked changes (for example, if you try to redo a problem but break something), and will make it easy to ask for help on Ed Discussion (just add a link to your repository with the current version of your code that isn't working as intended).
:::

### Open and Edit The Notebook {#sec-notebook}

#### Open Notebook and Select Julia Kernel

Open the `ae01.ipynb` file. 

::: {.callout-note}
## `.ipynb` files    
The `.ipynb` extension is for Jupyter notebooks, and this should be the primary file type you work with on most assignments for this course. 

Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of "cells, which are editable areas":
1. "Text" cells, in which you can write text using [Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook), which uses minimal styling to format text. You can see the "raw" Markdown for any cell by double clicking on it to make it editable. Text cells can also be used to format mathematics using [LaTeX syntax](https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis/tutorials/latex-notebook.html), but no LaTeX is actually required for this to work.
2. "Code" cells, which contain code which can be evaluated. The language of the code should match the kernel used for compilation (see below). A "play" button will appear next to a code cell which can be used to evaluate the cell's contents. **Be careful that running cells out of order can result in errors or bad results**, as each cell is evaluated independently, so if a function or variable is specified in a prior cell which is not executed, a later cell which requires those values will not work properly. Before submitting, make sure to evaluate all cells in order (for example, using the "Run All" button at the top of the VS Code window).
:::

In the upper right corner, you should see an icon similar to this (but perhaps with different text): 

![Kernel Selection Button](figures/kernel-selection.png). 

This is where you will click to select the "kernel" which is used to compile the Jupyter notebook. Click it, and you will be prompted to select a kernel. You likely need to select "Select Another Kernel...", then "Julia Language Support," and then "Julia 1.8 channel."

#### Edit Notebook

Finally, let's make some edits to the notebook. 

1. Double click the text cell at the top of the notebook that includes the "**Name**:" and "**ID**:" prompts. Add your name and Cornell NetID.
2. Create a code cell below this by hovering your cursor over the bottom of this text cell. You should see the following buttons pop up:
    ![Create New Cell](figures/new-cell.png)
    Click on "+Code" and the new cell should appear.
3. In this code cell, write a function to compute the square of a value $x$. The code should have the following basic structure:
    ```{julia}
    # the following is how you define a function 
    # called "square_function" which accepts an input argument x.
    function square_function(x)
        # put your code here
        return # add in the variable or value that should be returned
    end
    ```
    Test your function by computing $2^2$ and $4.5^2$.

### Export the Notebook {#sec-export-pdf}

Congratulations, you've set up Julia and GitHub and learned the basics of working with Jupyter Notebooks! The last step is to export the notebook for submission to Gradescope.

You should see the following menu bar at the top of the VS Code window:
![Notebook Menu Bar](figures/vs-code-top-bar.png)

1. Click "Run All" at the top to execute all of the cells in order. **Please do not forget to do this before exporting and submitting or you may lose points because your code has not been executed or may have errors**.
2. Click the ellipsis ("...") and select "Export". If you have LaTeX installed, you can click "PDF"; otherwise, click "HTML." Save the file, and then when prompted, open the file. This should open the page in your browser; go to the print interface and save as a PDF.
    ::: {.callout-tip}
    When printing to PDF, long lines will run off the edge of code cells, which may result in comments or code being hidden. If you see this, go back to the notebook and break up long lines into shorter onces (for example, see the comment in the above code cell) to ensure key parts of your results aren't missing.
    :::

Great! That's the basic workflow for every assignment in this course. 

Now you have your PDF that you can submit to Gradescope. Make sure that you tag pages corresponding to relevant problems to avoid a 10% penalty. For this exercise, tag page 1 for Problem 1 (submission of the PDF) and the page with your square function code for Problem 2.
